# Why this repo? 
Initially this repo was born because an in real life manufacturing bug. I was playing a game with numbers, not sure how is it called. 
This game consists of sliding numbers, you have a grid of / n x n/ numbers from /[1, n)/ and you need to order the numbers. In [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) you can find more information.

When I was playing this game I was unable to solve it. I was concerned because when I was like 8 years old I solved it easily and now I couldn't. 
In consecuence I started to implement the game in python, to prove that the game had an error and meanwhile I would be able to improve my Python skills. So that 
is the reason why I started this repo. Eventually I found out it was indeed impossible to solve the puzzble in certain starting conditions, I found a mathematica paper.

# What's next?
Well I did enjoy playing and implementing games, maybe finding an algorithmic solution. So in the next iterations of this project I would like to implement other games and find its solutions
